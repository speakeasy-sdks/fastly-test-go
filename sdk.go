	// A firewall represents a configuration of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on a service. A firewall has many firewall versions through which you can manage rules.
	//
	// https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/waf/firewall
	WafFirewalls *WafFirewalls
	// Firewall version objects contain all of the rules and settings for your WAF and remain empty until properly configured. To understand the behavior of thresholds and scores, see [Managing rules](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/managing-rules-on-the-fastly-waf#understanding-scoring-active-rule-behavior). Newly created firewall versions are initiated without any associated rules. See [Active Rules](/reference/api/waf/rules/active/) for details. Changes to your WAF's rules and settings can be made by [cloning](/reference/api/waf/firewall-version/#clone-waf-firewall-version) an existing firewall version, making the changes, and then [activating](/reference/api/waf/firewall-version/#deploy-activate-waf-firewall-version) the new firewall version.

	// WAF rule exclusions provide a flexible way to handle false positives, allowing specific variables, rules, and the entire WAF to be excluded on a per request basis. You can configure up to 300 WAF exclusions and each exclusion of type `rule` can have up to 30 rules associated with it.

	WafActiveRules *WafActiveRules
	// Rules are universally available for every firewall. Rules can have one or multiple [rule revisions](/reference/api/waf/rules/revisions/). You can add rules to your firewall by creating [active rules](/reference/api/waf/rules/active/).

	// Rule revisions track new variations of [rules](/reference/api/waf/rules/) as they change over time with enhancements, fixes, and improvements. This object allows you to find a specific variation of a rule for use in your application. An [active rule](/reference/api/waf/rules/active/) on a firewall uses a specific rule revision.
